#### Matrix Config - language.yml ##################################################
#
#     Hi, welcome to use Matrix anti-cheat, this is language.yml, which is used
#  to define the display language of anti-cheat. Here you can define what message
#  the anti-cheat displays.
#
#  - If you encounter any problems, please go to our official Discord
#  group for help: https://discord.gg/pEvY55J
#
#  Anyway, thanks for using Matrix anticheat! �?
#
#####################################################################################

# You can define the message prefix here
prefix: '&7[&bMatrix&7]&r '

# Define the announcement message after the player is kicked out by anti-cheating
kick-format: 'player %player% was kicked because of cheating!'

# Should Matrix broadcast a message when a player is kicked?
kick-broadcast: true

# What message should send to the player when Matrix detects
# that the player is sending chat messages too fast?
spam-warning: 'You can''t chat that fast or send the same content over again!'

# Define the format of the verbose message
#
#  What is "verbose message"?
#    When the player is detected by Matrix for any cheating, Matrix will output a
#    debugging message to display the detection information, which will be useful
#    for developers to debug anti-cheat. You can toggle it with the "/matrix verbose"
#    command, but usually you don’t need to read this message, it usually only needs
#    to be used when reporting a bug.
#
verbose-format: '&7%player% failed &2%check% &7check &8| &7%message% &b(+%add_vl%) &8| &7vl:%vl% ping:%ping% tps:%tps% lp:%lp% component: %component% ver: %version%'

# Defines the message that matrix blocks it when the player tries to quickly
# reconnect to the server after being kicked out by the anti-cheat
relog-message: 'Please wait %time_left% seconds before logging back in!'

# Global Placeholders, you can define constants here, you can use them in checks.yml
#
#  For example, define:
#     kick_help: "If you think it's a false positive, you can contact the Mod to solve the false kick"
#  then you can use %gp_kick_help% in checks.yml, It will be automatically replaced with this sentence
