# Should Matrix check update when starting up?
check_update: true

# Premium User - Verify the identity of premium/enterprise users
#
#   This is an authentication system that provides better service to paying users.
#  If you are premium user, you will get more additional KillAura/Scaffold/etc checks.
#  You can ignore this section if you are a free version user.
#
# In addition to the free version and the paid version, there is also an enterprise version.
# You can check their differences in the #premium-version channel of the official discord server
premium_user:
  # Login user name
  user: ''

  # Login password

# Should Matrix load the configuration file from Http(s) server (But ONLY for "checks.yml"!)
# Some large servers have dozens or even hundreds of sub-servers, so updating configuration
# files is very troublesome for them. This feature can help Matrix directly load configuration
# files from a central address.
cloud_config:
  # Enable this feature? (default: false)
  enable: false

  # you can add multiple links here, it can avoid losing configuration files due to a link going offline
  # If all links going offline, Matrix will use the default configuration
  links:
    - 'your configuration file link'

# Permission Cache refresh interval (unit: seconds, default: 15)
permission_refresh_interval: 15

# Enable BungeeCord GeyserMC Support?
# Matrix supports two ways to run GeyserMC:
#   1. Spigot Mode: Install GeyserMC/FloodGate in Spigot, you don’t need to modify this setting, Matrix will automatically support it
#   2. Bungee Mode: When GeyserMC is installed in BungeeCord, you need to enable this option and also install Matrix in BungeeCord
# !!!    Do NOT enable this option if you have NOT installed GeyserMC in BungeeCord
bungee_geysermc_support: false

# Should there be a lightning bolt visual effect if someone is getting kicked using /matrix kick
kick_strike_lightning: true

# Server Lag Protection
# Automatically disables some checks when your server is lagging. This prevents
# most, but not all, false positives from occuring.
tps_protection:
  # Enable this feature?
  enable: true

  # Minimum TPS needed to trigger protection
  min_tps: 17.0

  # Lag spike threshold (millisecond)
  # If the server does not respond for a certain period of time, then close the check
  lag_threshold: 1000

# Log Violations (default: true)
# Logs all violations to a file. Files can be found in /plugins/Matrix/logs
# Warning: If you are using BungeeCord, I recommend setting
# this to FALSE. This will prevent useless log files from
# being stored and using up precious disk space.
log_file: true

# Delete outdated log files (days)
# If the log file is stored for more than the specified number of days, the log file will be deleted
# You can set it to `-1` to disable this feature
delete_time: 30

# Deny Bypass Permission (default: false)
# By setting this option to TRUE, you are forcing Matrix to check everyone
# on the server, INCLUDING anyone who has Operator status. By setting this
# option to TRUE you can run the necessary tests without having to remove
# your operator status.
disable_bypass_permission: false

## Relog time
# How long after a player is kicked should he be allowed to log in (seconds)
# also, you can set -1 to disable this feature
relog_time: -1

# Disabled components
# You can disable a specific sub check here, instead of disabling the whole
# check, you can find component name in the end of verbose messages
# Example: If you add "speed.web" in the blow, the fast web check will
# be disabled
disabled_components:
  - 'example entry'

# Custom VL Weight (Format: component: new vl weight)
custom_vl_weight:
  - 'example_component:5'

# Fake AntiCheat Commands
